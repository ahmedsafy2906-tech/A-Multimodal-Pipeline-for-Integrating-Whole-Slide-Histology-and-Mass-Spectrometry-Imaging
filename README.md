# WSI to MSI Prediction Pipeline

## Overview
This project predicts molecular profiles from whole-slide histology images
using deep learning and spatial alignment with mass spectrometry imaging (MSI).

## Main Idea
- Extract patches from WSI
- Align them with MSI spots
- Use pretrained models (ResNet50, UNI)
- Predict MSI signals using regression models

## Project Status
Course project / research prototype.
