### UNI – Universal Histopathology Foundation Model (Mahmood Lab)

Several pipelines in this project rely on **UNI (Universal Histopathology Image Encoder)**, a large-scale foundation model for histopathology developed by the **Mahmood Lab (Harvard Medical School)**.

#### Model Description
- Name: UNI (Universal Histopathology Image Encoder)
- Architecture: Vision Transformer–based foundation model
- Training data: Millions of histopathology image patches from diverse tissue types
- Purpose: Learn generalizable morphological representations from H&E whole-slide images
- Usage in this project:
  - Feature extraction only
  - The model is used as a **frozen backbone**
  - No fine-tuning is performed

UNI serves as a strong visual encoder that captures tissue architecture, cellular morphology, and microenvironmental patterns, which are then used as input features for downstream regression and graph neural network models.

---

#### Model Source and Access
UNI is **not included** in this repository.

The model must be obtained directly from the official Mahmood Lab release via **Hugging Face**.

- Official source: Mahmood Lab (Harvard Medical School)
- Distribution platform: Hugging Face Model Hub
- Access restrictions: Requires authentication and acceptance of model terms

---

#### Hugging Face Token Requirement

To download UNI model weights, users must authenticate with Hugging Face.

Steps:
1. Create a Hugging Face account  
2. Generate an access token  
3. Authenticate locally using one of the following methods:

```bash
huggingface-cli login

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
